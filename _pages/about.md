Hi All!

My name is Chase Carstensen, I'm from southern New Hampshire, and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate studying Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA. I'm passionate about education and artificial intelligence/machine learning research.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to/playing music, playing video games or Magic: The Gathering, and being near the mountains or the ocean.
