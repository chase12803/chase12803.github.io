Hi All!

My name is Chase Carstensen, I'm from southern New Hampshire, and I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate studying Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA. I'm passionate about education, the climate, and artificial intelligence/machine learning research.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to/playing music, playing video games or Magic: The Gathering, and being near the mountains or the ocean.

- *August 2025-Present:* I've joined Prof. [Walter Gerych](https://waltergerych.github.io/)'s lab, where I'm working on minimally invasive and efficient debiasing methods for large pre-trained models.
- *August 2025-Present:* I'm working on my Major Qualifying Project with Prof. [Daniel Reichman](https://sites.google.com/view/danielreichman/home) and Prof. [Gábor Sárközy](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gsarkozy/). We are using ML/AI to find long induced paths in the hypercube.
- *May-August 2025:* I participated in the University of Colorado Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program titled "Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing" where we evaluated an LLM's ability to find counterexamples to claims in graph theory. **Publication in progress**
- *October-December 2024:* I spent 8 weeks in Prague, Czechia, completing my Interactive Qualifying Project. We used LLMs to label historical documents in the [Memory of Nations](https://www.memoryofnations.eu/en/archive) database.
- *October 2024:* I received a grant from the Computing Research Association to travel to Cambridge, MA and present my research from the WPI Data Science REU at the 2024 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference.
- *August-October 2024:* I continued my work from the WPI Data Science REU as an Independent Study Project.
- *May-August 2024:* I participated in the 2024 WPI Data Science REU Program with Prof. [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) where we used LLMs to screen for depression.
